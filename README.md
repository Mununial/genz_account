# GEN-Z UNIVERSITY (GZU)
## College Accounts & Finance Management System

A production-grade, secure, and responsive **College Accounts & Finance Management System** engineered for **GEN-Z UNIVERSITY (GZU)**. The platform provides full lifecycle financial operations across students, accounts staff, accounts head, college administration, and external auditors.

Built strictly with **HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and Hostinger MySQL (`mysql2`)** with zero frontend framework overhead and absolute single-source-of-truth database integrity.

---

## Key Highlights

- **Zero Client Trust Architecture:** All balances, late fines, scholarships, discounts, and payment allocations are strictly calculated server-side in MySQL and Express.js.
- **Guaranteed Student Data Isolation:** Students are permanently locked to their authenticated JWT session; cross-student financial inspection is mathematically impossible.
- **ACID Financial Transactions:** Payments and ledger settlements execute inside MySQL `START TRANSACTION ... FOR UPDATE` blocks, eliminating double-credits, race conditions, and ledger drift.
- **Replay & Tampering Prevention:** Server-side HMAC signature verification, order token hashing, and idempotency key checks.
- **Comprehensive 5-Tier RBAC:** `STUDENT`, `ACCOUNTS_STAFF`, `ACCOUNTS_HEAD`, `ADMIN`, and `AUDITOR_READ_ONLY`.
- **Authentic GENZ Cohort Integration:** Pre-seeded from Gen-Z University 1st-year reporting records (`final 1st Year database from reporting.xlsx`) across all 7 engineering departments.
- **Official Digital Receipts:** Verifiable digital receipts with unique numbers (`GZU-REC-YYYY-XXXXX`) and printable A4 layouts.
- **Automated Financial Intelligence:** Deterministic SQL-driven analytics flagging students with dues expiring in 3 days, overdue aging, and settlement discrepancies.
- **Hostinger Production Ready:** Native configuration for Hostinger Node.js application management and Hostinger MySQL database hosting.

### 3. Initialize & Seed Database
```bash
# If running local MySQL or remote Hostinger MySQL:
node database/init_db.js

### 4. Run Automated Test Suite
```bash
node tests/run_tests.js
```
*(Runs 34 automated unit and security tests verifying authentication, RBAC, student isolation, payments, and reporting).*

### 5. Start Application Server

## Hostinger Production Deployment

For complete, step-by-step instructions on setting up MySQL, Node.js applications, and Let's Encrypt SSL on Hostinger hPanel, refer to:
[HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT.md](file:///c:/Users/munun/OneDrive/Desktop/bec_account/HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT.md)

## Production Security Measures

- **Password Hashing:** `bcryptjs` with 12 salt rounds; plain-text passwords are never stored.
- **Brute Force Protection:** Strict rate-limiting (`express-rate-limit`) on authentication endpoints.
- **Parameterized SQL:** All queries use `mysql2` parameterized inputs (`?`) to prevent SQL Injection.
- **HTTP Headers:** `helmet` enabled for XSS, MIME-sniffing, and frameguard protection.
- **Student Isolation:** Verified at the middleware layer; tokens permanently lock student queries to their own records.
- **Audit Logging:** Every financial mutation (payments, cancellations, refunds, adjustments) writes an immutable record to `audit_logs`.
- **Zero Framework Vulnerabilities:** Pure Vanilla JavaScript on the frontend eliminates frontend supply-chain risks and bundler bloat.
